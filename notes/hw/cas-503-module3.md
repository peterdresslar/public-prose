# Analysis of Collective Systems (M3)

*Peter Dresslar, CAS 503, 2026*

## Introduction

I have selected three systems that are not necessarily maximally collective on multiple levels, but rather ones which strike me as interesting tests of individuality. I will apply my recently-proposed idea of synergizing Krakauer, Kauffman, and Hoel into a system I am calling "Kantian individuality." Unfamiliar readers can find a (mercifully!) brief summary of this formulation at the top of my module three Yellowdig post or at [this link](https://github.com/peterdresslar/public-prose/blob/main/notes/hw/kantian-individuals.md).

## Example one: The mother-daughter dyad collective, separately understood as a gravida-foster pair of the homo sapiens species. ^1

Gestating *homo sapiens* and her unborn embryo/fetus can be evaluated as a mother-daughter collective.^1 While it is sometimes said of complex systems that "more is different," and here we have a collective of only two, we can also observe that the interconnections between the dyads members---themselves the most collectively multi-tiered phenomena known to observation---involve: hundreds of interoperating systems; a typically (for biology) multi-tiered operational time-scale; and trillions of individual constituents.

### Tests for Kantian individuality

The mother-daughter dyad is an excellent (if fraught) test for considering our Kantian individuality framework. To begin, let us accept that the mother of the dyad is unquestionably a Kantian individual (such as there might be such a thing).

Each dyad member is clearly an individual on the merits of genetic code, let alone many other informational effects each embodies. Causally, we can immediately see that the mother's cognition is unambiguously necessary and sufficient for agentic dynamics of the system, and yet the daughter of the dyad is far from causally degenerate. Our constraint closure test is perhaps the least easy to settle; while at first glance we might say that there is a clear constraint-closure difference amongst the dyad, consideration of edge cases is warranted. We can say unequivocally, though, that there are many conditions where daughter---an individual with some level of causal agency---is not a Kantian whole.

Considering the dyad itself, we have a distinct collective individual; it seems likely that any pairing of interoperating organisms would qualify as such. Things get particularly interesting when we consider collective causality, since the collective unambiguously imparts real temporal effects on mother and daughter alike. As for constraint closure, the dyad itself clearly maintains it, though arguably this is achieved as a special case.

Might we call a mother with her unborn offspring a distinct Kantian individual composed of two individuals?


## Example two: The Great Red Spot of Jupiter.

Sol system's "best-known and [presently] longest-lived anticyclone"^ is the Great Red Spot (GRS), known to be occurring on Jupiter since at least the year 1664, and for which reliable observational data has been gathered since 1878. While its rotational fluid dynamics are reminiscent of terrestrial tropical storms, the GRS is far more linear in function ^^: this linearity and the GRS's appearance as a singular large feature on Jupiter are both predicted by simulations.^

Jupiter's GRS vortex behavior is predicted in simulations to scale linearly with size, with expected bifurcation points into a semi-stable phase space as the vortex becomes the single such feature on the spheroid. TODO cite, clean up.


### Tests for Kantian individuality

We have little to say for our tiny, insignificant Great Red Spot except that it is indeed a qualifying individual in the Krakaeur sense. Note, though, that as an individual it is one that generates perhaps a surprising amount information: a search for novel titles including the words "Great Red Spot" will confirm this.

## Example three: A temporary collective of two female chickens caring jointly for a combined brood of approximately 15 chicks in Ewa Beach, Hawaii, as observed in 2025

With this example, we examine the behavior of one particular collective of female chickens (gallus gallus) as privately observed and documented by the author from his home neighborhood in 2025. Feral chickens in Hawaii seasonally brood upon clutches of one (1) to fifteen (15) eggs until they hatch; at this point the female will engage exclusively devoted to broods that they hatch, forming strongly-related family collectives with 

### Emergent functional behavior and enhancement/degradation at scale

Functional behavior exhibited includes a cooperative brood strategy leading to the coalescing of two (typically competitive) chicken broods into a single collective headed by a joint collective. Specific functionality to consider includes absolute temporal advantage of dual vigilance---this could be measured as time on-vigilance-task versus non-dyad broods---and in particular an expanded "safe" radius for chicks. Due to the very causally-connected nature of the flock, scaling considerations are secondary. 

## Field Report and Collective Behavior Commentary

#### Field Report
The following observations derive from approximately 500 sessions of direct observation of a feral chicken colony in Ewa Beach, Hawaiʻi, over four years (2021-2025). The co-parenting collective described here was observed over eight weeks in early 2025.

**Colony and environmental context:**
Hawaiʻi presents unusual parameter conditions: 
- food is abundant in the extreme (anthropogenic sources, insect pests); 
- temperature is near-constant and low-stress (~70-90°F); 
- water is generally human-provided; and predation is anomalously low (mongooses, feral cats, dogs — very few avian predators). 

Hawaiʻi is thus, in effect, a "paradise world" for for *Gallus gallus*. These conditions produce larger clutch sizes (15+ eggs), and high hatch success rates.^^[TODO Note and citation: what do we know about these data compared to other places] Notably, the primary mortal threat to chicks is separation from the hen, rather than direct predation. Separation at young age (~ < 2 wks.), as observed in dozens of cases, is typically fatal within one overnight period. Population density frequently reaches local carrying capacity, at which point human intervention (removal, destruction) becomes the limiting factor.

**Observed collective behavior:**
Two visually distinct, apparently unrelated hens were observed co-parenting a combined brood of approximately fifteen chicks:

- Both hens food-called to all chicks; all chicks responded to either hen
- No aggression between hens or toward "foreign" chicks
- Chicks interacted as apparent siblings regardless of maternal origin
- Hens displayed alternating head-up/head-down "vigilance" postures during foraging TODO note/citation
- Dual vigilance was seen to aid flock cohesion against perturbations on two occasions (perturbations: car, dog)
- Brood maintained spatial coherence as a single unit
- One chick loss observed over eight-week observation period

CAPTION: Figure 1. Emergent cooperative behaviors in a feral Gallus gallus dyad (Ewa Beach, HI, 2025). (Top Left) High-constraint closure: The two hens maintain direct physical contact while resting ("creching"), a proximity typically associated with aggression in non-cooperating feral hens. (Top Right & Bottom Right) Joint resource supervision: The hens food-call to the combined clutch indiscriminately, suppressing the resource-guarding instincts typical of single mothers. (Bottom Left) Emergent vigilance: The dyad maintains spatial coherence while foraging; note the tan hen maintaining a "head-up" scanning posture while the black hen feeds ("head-down"), illustrating a division of labor that reduces individual cost while maintaining collective safety.

**Contrast with typical behavior:**
Single-hen broods in the same colony display typical inter-brood aggression. Hens routinely eject or attack exogenous chicks---with the endogenous chicks sometimes contributing aggression---particularly during feeding. A common hazard routinely observed is that of a separated chick attempting to re-form with a different brood: this chick is almost always rejected, and sometimes harmed, by the exogenous hen. 

The co-parenting dyad was thus extremely unusual within this behavioral context.

#### Brief background

The behavior of egg-laying, brooding, hatching, and then leading a tightly geospatially-associated flock of offspring characterizes Gallus gallus and several other domesticated bird species as "precocial."^^ Vigilance behavior in chickens and other such precocial birds has been extensively studied, with hens exhibiting characteristic head-up scanning postures while foraging. ^^ Inter-brood aggression is well-documented: hens routinely reject and attack exogenous chicks, particularly during feeding.^^ While complex collective behaviors in bird flocks—including phase transitions representing abrupt qualitative shifts in group dynamics—have been described in the complexity science literature, such analysis of precocial flocks appears far more limited. ^^

#### Analysis and Discussion

It seems possible that we have observed a specific instance of a phase shift in flock leadership strategies, in which cooperation urges overwhelmed the natural competitive instincts of the two hens. Suspicion that a phase shift appears here is particularly heightened in the context of the strong environmental characteristics. With food and comfort generally maximized for the chickens, a strategy of mutual vigilance seems likely to overwhelm the resource concerns driving competition. 

Formal exploration and characterization of emergent collective phenomena in feral Gallus gallus of Hawaiʻi would require significant additional data. The specific geometry of two flock leaders successfully reshaping and reforming the flock seems like a testable system, and a collective individual simulation may prove elucidating.

We might observe that a chicken collective of hen and brood is similar to an insect hive in some ways related specifically to individuality. Each member of the collective is unambiguously a Kantian whole, and yet the chicks are very reliant on the central figure of the collective---the hen---to survive. Their constraint closure is, in other words, poorly-maintained. While the hens of the dyad are unambiguously Kantian individuals, the chicks pose more ambiguity. Meanwhile, the flock itself is a clear collective individual with some (usually) mortal parts and very cohesive causal primacy. Perhaps not a Kantian individual, but worth consideration.







## Footnotes

^1 By way of explanation, via Geddes (p. 476.):

The gravida is the pregnant organism. The foster is that with which the gravida is pregnant: roughly, the post-implantation embryo or foetus. (As Kingma (2019: 611) notes, if organisms count as being pregnant post-fertilization but pre-implantation, then zygotes and pre-implantation embryos can be fosters too.) Talk of the foster reflects the presumption of a singleton pregnancy. In a multiple pregnancy, there are multiple fosters.

While this description is useful, there is very little language describing, I use mother-daughter to connote the absolute genetic (informational) distinction between the two.

Are "jets" (in the Bouchet and Sommeria sense) actually particles, *i.e.*, collective phenomena? Certainly composed of particles, but TODO formalize

Has anyone analyzed the persistent homology of the GRS?
