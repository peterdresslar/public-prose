# Analysis of Collective Systems (Module 3)

*Peter Dresslar, CAS 503, 2026*

## Introduction

I have selected two "minor" systems that are not necessarily maximally-collective, but rather ones which strike me as interesting tests of individuality. I will apply my recently-proposed idea of combining Krakauer, Kauffman, and Hoel into a system I am calling "Kantian individuality." Unfamiliar readers can find a (mercifully!) brief summary of this formulation at the top of my module three Yellowdig post or at [this link](https://github.com/peterdresslar/public-prose/blob/main/notes/hw/kantian-individuals.md).

For my third ("major") system, there were so many strong examples to choose from, but I decided to work with one for which I have a bit of primary observational data. I hope the reviewers enjoy this selection.

## Example one: The mother-daughter dyad collective

Gestating *homo sapiens* and her unborn embryo/fetus can be evaluated as a mother-daughter collective. (Geddes 2023, 476) While it is sometimes said of complex systems that "more is different," and here we have a collective of only two, we can also observe that the interconnections between mother and daughter---themselves quite complex---involve: hundreds of inter-operating systems; a typically (for biology) multi-tiered operational time-scale; and trillions of individual constituents.

### Emergent functional behavior and enhancement/degradation at scale

While a complete catalog of emergent functioning of the dyad is beyond the scope of our "minor" systems, we can identify some important categories of emergent behavior:

Locomotive movement and positioning is non-trivially complex during pregnancy. The uterus provides specific locomotive feedback in peristaltic "waves" to the implanting embryo (Bulletti & de Ziegler 2006, 473); later in pregnancy the pair execute a number of physical reconfigurations that aid development. (Leftwich & Baumer 2024, 171)

The chemical communication between mother and daughter coordinates systems that are running on a number of biological clocks, with development phases in the daughter triggering responses in the mother, sometimes with a lag in larger volumes or even stiff membranes. (Masserdotti et al. 2024, 6) The resulting trimestral calendar (and even postpartum response) for the mother can be seen as driven by predictable phase changes arising from hysteresis. (Bar et al. 2023, 6-12)

The complex immune interplay between mother and daughter, mediated through the placental wall, results in major positive changes to the immune systems of both individuals. (Ciaunica et al. 2023, 2) This is a surprising example of adversarial complex behavior.

When considering the scale of the system, we might consider that the dyad is at the lowest limit of collectivity (two individuals) in a vertical sense, yet extremely wide in a horizontal (many systems) sense.

### Tests for Kantian individuality

The mother-daughter dyad is an excellent (if fraught) test for considering our Kantian individuality framework. To begin, let us accept that the mother of the dyad is unquestionably a Kantian individual (such as there might be such a thing).

Each dyad member is clearly an individual on the merits of genetic code, let alone many other informational effects each embodies. Causally, we can immediately see that the mother's cognition is unambiguously necessary and sufficient for agentic dynamics of the system, and yet the daughter of the dyad is far from causally degenerate. Our constraint closure test is perhaps the least easy to settle; while at first glance we might say that there is a clear constraint-closure difference amongst the dyad, consideration of edge cases is warranted. We can say unequivocally, though, that there are many conditions where daughter---an individual with some level of causal agency---is not a Kantian whole.

Considering the dyad itself, we have a distinct collective individual; it seems likely that any pairing of organisms would qualify as such. Things get particularly interesting when we consider collective causality, since the collective unambiguously imparts real temporal effects on mother and daughter alike. As for constraint closure, the dyad itself clearly maintains it, though arguably this is achieved as a special case. (for discussion, see Ciaunica et al. 2023, 11)

Might we call a mother with her unborn offspring a distinct Kantian individual composed of two individuals?

## Example two: The Great Red Spot of Jupiter

Sol system's "best-known and [presently] longest-lived anticyclone" (Simon et al. 2024, 1) is the Great Red Spot (GRS), for which reliable observational data has been gathered since at least 1878. (Simon et al. 2018, 1) While its rotational fluid dynamics are reminiscent of terrestrial tropical storms, the GRS is more linear in function: this linearity and the GRS's appearance as a singular large feature on Jupiter are both predicted by simulations. (Sommeria et al. 1988, 691)

### Emergent functional behavior and enhancement/degradation at scale
The Great Red Spot exhibits persistent vorticity with a wide range of recurrent secondary features including asymmetric tangential jets (called "chimneys") and the generation of smaller secondary whorls called "white ovals." (Simon et al. 2018, 2)

Research from the last century modeled Jupiter's GRS vortex behavior as being relatively linear and stable when compared to terrestrial storms. (Sommeria et al. 1988, 693) While this core concept continues to be generally recognized today, more recent research benefits from vastly-superior three-dimensional data from the planet. (Zhang & Marcus 2024, 985)

Cai et al. (2022, 3) identify structures called "instantaneous positive/negative vortical structures" generated in the three-dimensional structure of the Jovian atmosphere which translate to the two dimensional stability of vortices like the GRS. These structures are seen to be very sensitive to one specific parameter called the "convective Rossby number," which, being related to the planet's radius, is extremely low on Jupiter. (Flasar 1980, 5)

This relationship explains in part how the scale of Jupiter contributes to the phenomenology of the GRS.

While the functional behavior of the Great Red Spot is far less complex than our biological examples, there exists at least one documented connection between the emergent dynamics of the storm and life on Earth. Chavanis (2006, 239) proposes analysis of the chemotaxis (movement or spread of bacteria toward a resource gradient) by leveraging equations initially proposed to model the storm's jet-flow, and again leveraging a constant similar to the Rossby number. (Chavanis 2006, 241) This connection is reminiscent specifically of Krakauer's section on colonial individuality:

> When this measure is minimized an individual becomes completely insensitive to the environment...and not in
any real sense adaptive. It represents the persistence of an environmental memory capable through interaction with the system of generating structure, such as temperature gradients in a fluid that produce vortices. (Krakauer 2020, 216)

### Tests for Kantian individuality

Our evaluation for the Great Red Spot is simple: while it is indeed a qualifying individual in the Krakauer sense, the storm does not qualify in any other manner of closure or causality. Note, though, that as a "simple" collective individual, the phenomenon generates (albeit indirectly) a surprising amount information several astronomical units away from Jupiter: a search for science fiction novel titles containing the words "Great Red Spot" will confirm this.

## Example three: A temporary collective of two female chickens caring jointly for a combined brood of approximately 15 chicks in Ewa Beach, Hawaii, as observed in 2025

With this example, we examine the behavior of one particular collective of female chickens (gallus gallus) as privately observed and documented by the author from his home neighborhood in 2025. Feral chickens in Hawaii seasonally brood upon clutches of one (1) to fifteen (15) eggs until they hatch; at this point the female will engage exclusively devoted to broods that they hatch, forming strongly-related family collectives we can label "flocks."

### Emergent functional behavior and enhancement/degradation at scale

Functional behavior exhibited includes a cooperative brood strategy leading to the coalescing of two (typically competitive) chicken broods into a single collective headed by a joint collective. Specific functionality to consider includes absolute temporal advantage of dual vigilance---this could be measured as time on-vigilance-task versus non-dyad broods---and in particular an expanded "safe" radius for chicks. Due to the very causally-connected nature of the flock, scaling considerations are secondary. 

## Field Report and Collective Behavior Commentary

#### Field Report
The following observations derive from approximately 500 sessions of direct observation of a feral chicken colony in Ewa Beach, Hawaiʻi, over four years (2021-2025). The co-parenting collective described here was observed over eight weeks in early 2025.

**Colony and environmental context:**
Hawaiʻi presents unusual parameter conditions: 
- food is abundant in the extreme (anthropogenic sources, insect pests); 
- temperature is near-constant and low-stress (~70-90°F); 
- water is generally human-provided; and predation is anomalously low (mongooses, feral cats, dogs — very few avian predators). 

Hawaiʻi is thus, in effect, a "paradise world" for for *Gallus gallus*. These conditions produce larger clutch sizes (15+ eggs), and high hatch success rates when compared to continental data (Carleial 2020, 12) Notably, the primary mortal threat to chicks is separation from the hen, rather than direct predation. Separation at young age (~ < 2 wks.), as observed in dozens of cases, is typically fatal within one overnight period. Population density frequently reaches local carrying capacity, at which point human intervention (removal, destruction) becomes the limiting factor.

**Observed collective behavior:**
Two visually distinct, apparently unrelated hens were observed co-parenting a combined brood of approximately fifteen chicks:

- Both hens food-called to all chicks; all chicks responded to either hen
- No aggression between hens or toward "foreign" chicks
- Chicks interacted as apparent siblings regardless of maternal origin
- Hens displayed alternating head-up/head-down "vigilance" postures during foraging (see Kazara 2019)
- Dual vigilance was seen to aid flock cohesion against perturbations on two occasions (perturbations: car, dog)
- Brood maintained spatial coherence as a single unit
- One chick loss observed over eight-week observation period

**Contrast with typical behavior:**
Single-hen broods in the same colony display typical inter-brood aggression. Hens routinely eject or attack exogenous chicks---with the endogenous chicks sometimes contributing aggression---particularly during feeding. A common hazard routinely observed is that of a separated chick attempting to re-form with a different brood: this chick is almost always rejected, and sometimes harmed, by the exogenous hen. 

The co-parenting dyad was thus extremely unusual within this behavioral context.

#### Brief background

The behavior of egg-laying, brooding, hatching, and then leading a tightly geospatially-associated flock of offspring characterizes Gallus gallus and several other domesticated bird species as "precocial" (Mench & Keeling 2001, 186) Vigilance behavior in chickens and other such precocial birds has been extensively studied, with hens exhibiting characteristic head-up scanning postures while foraging (Kazara 2019, 8). Inter-brood aggression is well-documented: hens routinely reject and attack exogenous chicks, particularly during feeding (Rush 1978, 12). While complex collective behaviors in bird flocks—including phase transitions representing abrupt qualitative shifts in group dynamics—have been described in complexity science literature (Romanczuk & Daniels 2023), similar direct analysis of precocial flocks appears far more limited.

#### Analysis and Discussion

It seems possible that we have observed a specific instance of a phase shift in flock leadership strategies, in which cooperation urges overwhelmed the natural competitive instincts of the two hens. Suspicion that a phase shift appears here is particularly heightened in the context of the strong environmental characteristics. With food and comfort generally maximized for the chickens, a strategy of mutual vigilance seems likely to overwhelm the resource concerns driving competition. 

Formal exploration and characterization of emergent collective phenomena in feral Gallus gallus of Hawaiʻi would require significant additional data. The specific geometry of two flock leaders successfully reshaping and reforming the flock seems like a testable system, and a collective individual simulation may prove elucidating.

### Tests for Kantian individuality

We might observe that a chicken collective of hen and brood is similar to an insect hive in some ways related specifically to individuality. Each member of the collective is unambiguously a Kantian whole, and yet the chicks are very reliant on the central figure of the collective---the hen---to survive. Their constraint closure is, in other words, poorly-maintained. While the hens of the dyad are unambiguously Kantian individuals, the chicks pose more ambiguity. Meanwhile, the flock itself is a clear collective individual with some (usually) mortal parts and very cohesive causal primacy. Perhaps not a Kantian individual, but worth consideration.
